## ✅ What Experts Validated

### Expert 1: Off-Topic Handling Specialist

**Quote:**
> "The bar isn't just *accuracy*—it's a concierge that **lets Gemini be smart**, handles **off‑topic** gracefully, and steers back to the store **without sounding robotic or over‑guarded**."

**Validation:**
- ✅ Gemini-led orchestration is correct
- ✅ 2-3 product discipline is correct
- ✅ Progressive clarification is correct
- ✅ Testing infrastructure is comprehensive

**New Request:** Add off-topic pivot capability (6 scenarios + 1 judge)

### Expert 2: Code Architecture Specialist

**Quote:**
> "Latest commits show **artifacts, shop resolution, judge snapshots, style softening** in place and **TypeScript errors fixed**. The earlier low pass rate was **environmental**; with DB alignment and your prompt/threshold changes, **60–80%** pass is realistic."

**Validation:**
- ✅ Code is production-grade
- ✅ 44 test cases are comprehensive
- ✅ Shop resolver is correct
- ✅ Monitoring infrastructure is complete
- ✅ TypeScript errors fixed

**Confirmation:** DB schema is the only blocker (already identified)

## 💡 Key Insights from Experts

### 1. Our Implementation is Production-Grade

**Expert 1:**
> "I've designed this to fit your existing code/tests (natural prompt, judges, persona linter, goldens, dead‑end scenarios, drift & perf monitors)."

**Expert 2:**
> "The **code, tests, and monitoring are production‑grade**. Your latest commit explicitly calls out the **DB schema mismatch** as the only remaining practical blocker."

**Takeaway:** Both experts validate our core architecture. The work ahead is **additive** (off-topic) and **infrastructure** (DB schema).

### 2. The 26.7% Pass Rate Was Environmental

**Expert 2:**
> "The earlier **26.7% pass rate** was **mostly environmental**—'shop not found' accounted for >50% of fails—and your **shopResolver + seed** work addresses that."

**Takeaway:** Not a code quality issue. Once DB is fixed, expect 60-80% pass rate.

### 3. Off-Topic is the Missing Piece

**Expert 1:**
> "The bar isn't just *accuracy*—it's a concierge that **lets Gemini be smart**, handles **off‑topic** gracefully, and steers back to the store **without sounding robotic or over‑guarded**."

**Takeaway:** We handle on-topic brilliantly. Off-topic pivots are the final 5% to reach world-class.

### 4. Keep Gemini in Control

**Expert 1:**
> "**Keep Gemini firmly in the driver's seat**; add a **tiny "Side‑Quest & Pivot" policy** so off‑topic replies feel human and helpful."

**Takeaway:** Don't over-engineer. Give Gemini a playbook, not rigid rules.
