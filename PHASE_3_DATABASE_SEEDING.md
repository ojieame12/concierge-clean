## üîß Seed Script Features

### Works with Existing Schema
- ‚úÖ Adapts to Supabase UUID-based schema
- ‚úÖ Handles existing `shops`, `products`, `store_cards` tables
- ‚úÖ Generates fake `shopify_product_id` from hash
- ‚úÖ Stores rich metadata in `raw` JSONB field

### Idempotent Seeding
- ‚úÖ Upserts shops (finds existing or creates new)
- ‚úÖ Upserts store cards (updates if exists)
- ‚úÖ Updates products if handle already exists
- ‚úÖ Safe to run multiple times

### Smart Data Handling
- ‚úÖ Maps logical shop IDs to UUID shop IDs
- ‚úÖ Validates price > 0 before inserting
- ‚úÖ Sets product status based on stock (active/draft)
- ‚úÖ Preserves all product metadata for retrieval

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Local Seeding
```bash
cd backend
export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
npm run seed
```

### Output
```
üå± Starting database seed...
üì¶ Loaded 2 shops, 2 store cards, 6 shoes, 5 boards
‚úì Found existing shop: run.local (uuid)
‚úì Found existing shop: snow.local (uuid)
‚úì Seeded 2 store cards
‚úì Seeded 11 products
‚úÖ Seed complete
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow (Updated Locally)

**Note:** The workflow file was updated locally but couldn't be pushed due to GitHub App permissions. To apply:

1. Manually edit `.github/workflows/conversation-quality.yml` on GitHub
2. Add Postgres service:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
    ports: 
      - 5432:5432
    options: >-
      --health-cmd="pg_isready -U postgres"
      --health-interval=10s
      --health-timeout=5s
      --health-retries=5
```

3. Add seeding step before tests:

```yaml
- name: Seed test database
  working-directory: backend
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
  run: npm run seed
```

4. Update test step with DATABASE_URL:

```yaml
- name: Run conversation quality tests
  working-directory: backend
  run: npm run test:conversations
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
    # ... other env vars
```

## üîç Data Verification

### Check Seeded Data

**Shops:**
```sql
SELECT id, shop_domain FROM shops WHERE shop_domain IN ('run.local', 'snow.local');
```

**Store Cards:**
```sql
SELECT shop_id, store_name, brand_voice->>'personality' as personality 
FROM store_cards;
```

**Products:**
```sql
SELECT title, vendor, price, currency, status 
FROM products 
WHERE shop_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM shops WHERE shop_domain IN ('run.local', 'snow.local')
)
ORDER BY price;
```

**Product Details:**
```sql
SELECT 
  title, 
  raw->>'rating' as rating,
  raw->>'review_count' as reviews,
  raw->'attributes' as attributes
FROM products 
WHERE handle LIKE 'shoe-%' OR handle LIKE 'snow-%';
```

## üö¶ Status

### ‚úÖ Complete
- Database seeding infrastructure
- Realistic product catalogs
- Store configurations with brand voice
- Idempotent seed script
- Local testing verified

### üìù Manual Step Required
- Update GitHub Actions workflow (permissions issue)
- Copy Postgres service + seeding steps to workflow file

### üîÑ Ready For
- End-to-end conversation testing
- Golden conversation test execution
- Dead-end scenario validation
- Variant-switching tests

---

## üéì What We Learned

### 1. Schema Adaptation
The existing Supabase schema uses UUIDs and has specific required fields. The seed script successfully adapts by:
- Generating UUIDs for new records
- Creating fake `shopify_product_id` from hash
- Storing extended metadata in `raw` JSONB field

### 2. Idempotent Design
Seeding can be run multiple times safely:
- Finds existing shops by domain
- Upserts store cards by shop_id
- Updates products by handle
- No duplicate data created

### 3. Test Data Quality
Realistic test data is crucial:
- Product names sound authentic
- Specifications are accurate
- Prices are believable
- Ratings and reviews are realistic

### 4. Stock Scenarios
Including out-of-stock products enables testing:
- Dead-end handling
- Variant switching
- Graceful recovery
- Upsell behavior

---

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual)
1. **Update GitHub Actions workflow** (copy Postgres service + seeding steps)
2. **Trigger workflow run** to verify CI/CD integration
3. **Monitor test results** in GitHub Actions

### Phase 3 Continuation
1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Run golden conversation tests with real data
   - Validate quality gates pass
   - Test with both shops (running shoes + snowboards)

2. **Add Dead-End Tests**
   - `CONV-RUN-02`: Out-of-stock variant handling
   - `CONV-SNOW-02`: Dead-end budget scenario
   - Validate recovery and upsell behavior

3. **Manual Conversation Testing**
   - Test 10-20 real conversations
   - Collect feedback
   - Identify edge cases

### Phase 4 (Week 4)
1. **A/B Testing**
   - Deploy to 10% of traffic
   - Track metrics
   - Compare with current pipeline

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time quality scores
   - Conversation analytics
   - User satisfaction tracking

3. **Production Rollout**
   - Gradual increase (10% ‚Üí 100%)
   - Quality monitoring
   - Full migration
