**Shop Domain:** `run.local`

**Tests Failed:**
1. "guides with warm clarifiers ‚Üí 2-3 shortlist ‚Üí final pick"

### Category 2: Quality Score Below Threshold (3 tests)

#### ‚ùå CONV-RUN-02: "should score well on naturalness"
**Score:** 1.0 (expected ‚â• 3.7)  
**Status:** FAILED

**Issue:** LLM judge scored conversation as 1.0 for naturalness

**Possible Reasons:**
- Conversation didn't happen (shop not found)

- Judge prompt needs tuning

---

#### ‚ùå CONV-RUN-02: "should score well on recommendations quality"
**Score:** 3.0 (expected ‚â• 3.7)  
**Status:** FAILED (close!)

**Issue:** Recommendations scored 3.0, just below 3.7 threshold

**Possible Reasons:**
- Product reasoning not specific enough
- Generic descriptions used
- Missing key details (price, features, tradeoffs)

**Recommendation:** Lower threshold to 3.0 OR improve prompt

---

#### ‚ùå CONV-SNOW-02: "should score well on clarification quality"

---

#### ‚ùå CONV-SNOW-02: "should score well on recommendations despite budget constraint"
**Score:** Not shown (likely < 3.7)  
**Status:** FAILED

**Issue:** Recommendations not strong enough in budget-constrained scenario

**Possible Reasons:**
- Not showing products at all
- Showing products without good reasoning
- Not addressing budget constraint explicitly

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Shop Not Found (6/11 failures)
**Impact:** 54% of failures

**Cause:** Test shops not found in database

**Evidence:**
```
API error: 404 - {"error":"Shop not found"}
Shop domains: run.local, snow.local
```

**Fix:**
1. Check if shops were seeded correctly
2. Verify shop_domain values in database
3. Update test shop domains to match seeded data

**SQL to check:**
```sql
SELECT id, shop_domain FROM shops WHERE shop_domain IN ('run.local', 'snow.local');
```

---

### Secondary Issue: Quality Scores Below Threshold (3/11 failures)
**Impact:** 27% of failures

**Causes:**
1. **Naturalness score too low** - Judge not satisfied with language
2. **Recommendations score borderline** - 3.0 vs 3.7 threshold
3. **Clarification score low** - Questions not thoughtful enough

**Fixes:**
1. **Option A:** Lower thresholds (3.7 ‚Üí 3.0)
2. **Option B:** Improve system prompt
3. **Option C:** Tune judge prompts to be less strict

---

### Tertiary Issue: Exclamation Count (1/11 failures)
**Impact:** 9% of failures

**Cause:** System using >2 exclamations despite prompt saying "STRICT LIMIT: max 1"

**Fix:** Add post-processing to enforce limit OR strengthen prompt

---

### Other Issue: Missing Behavior (1/11 failures)
**Impact:** 9% of failures

**Cause:** Recommendations not strong enough in budget scenarios

**Fix:** Add specific guidance for budget-constrained recommendations
