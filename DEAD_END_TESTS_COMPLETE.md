## 📝 Test Files Created

### 1. CONV-RUN-02: Out-of-Stock Variant Recovery

**What It Tests:**
- ✅ Clarification before rejection
- ✅ Honest budget discussion
- ✅ Value-focused recommendations
- ✅ Tasteful upsells (no pressure)
- ✅ Empathetic tone throughout

---

### 3. Documentation
**File:** `backend/tests/conversations/DEAD_END_TESTS.md`  
**Lines:** 300+  
**Content:**
- Test scenario descriptions
- Key principles (empathy over apology, value over price)
- Recovery strategies
- Execution instructions
- Expected output
- Debugging guide

---

### 4. Jest Configuration Update
**File:** `backend/jest.conversations.config.js`  
**Change:** Added `maxWorkers: 1`  
**Reason:** Run tests sequentially to avoid Gemini API rate limits (15 req/min free tier)

---

## 🔑 Key Principles Tested

### 1. Empathy Over Apology
**Bad:** "I apologize for the inconvenience, but that item is currently unavailable."  
**Good:** "The black size 9 is sold out right now, but I've got a couple options that might work even better."

### 2. Clarify Before Rejecting
**Bad:** "We don't have any boards under $250."  
**Good:** "What's bringing you to snowboarding? If you're just starting out, I can explain why the $329 option is actually perfect for beginners."

### 3. Value Over Price
**Bad:** "This costs $329."  
**Good:** "At $329, the ParkPop 148 is catch-free and super forgiving—exactly what you want when learning."

### 4. Tasteful Upsells
**Bad:** "For just $50 more, you can get the premium model!"  
**Good:** "The Snowline Nova at $389 has a more versatile profile—works great on groomers and in powder, while the ParkPop is more park-focused."

### 5. Natural Language
**Bad:** "I am unable to locate products matching your criteria."  
**Good:** "I don't see anything hitting that price point, but let me show you what's close."

## 🎓 Recovery Strategies

### Stock-Aware Ranking
1. Prefer in-stock products
2. Keep OOS only if explicitly requested by name
3. Mention stock status naturally

### Dead-End Recovery Order
1. **Sibling variant** (same model, different color/size)
2. **Nearest spec match** within budget
3. **Tasteful upsell** (≤20% over budget, dominates on ≥2 features)

### Action Suggestions
- Always include "Notify me" for OOS items
- Suggest "Adjust filters" with one gentle relaxation
- Never pressure or create false urgency

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Rate Limiting is Critical
Gemini's 15 req/min limit means tests MUST run sequentially. `maxWorkers: 1` prevents failures.

### 2. Dead-Ends Reveal Character
How a system handles "no" reveals its true nature. These tests ensure empathy, not evasion.

### 3. Clarification > Rejection
Asking "what matters most?" before saying "we don't have that" is the difference between helpful and dismissive.

### 4. Value > Price
Explaining WHY something costs more (and is worth it) builds trust. Just stating prices doesn't.

### 5. Upsells Need Reasoning
"$50 more" is pushy. "More versatile profile for groomers and powder" is helpful.
