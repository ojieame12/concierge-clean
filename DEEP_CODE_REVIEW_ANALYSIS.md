# Deep Code Review Analysis & Implementation Plan

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Reviewer:** Expert Code Auditor (Full Codebase Review)  
**Status:** 5 Blocking Issues + 3 High-Impact Improvements Identified  
**Action Required:** Surgical Fixes (2-3 hours)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

An expert conducted a **complete end-to-end code review** of the actual codebase (not just documentation). This is the most detailed, actionable feedback yet.

**Key Finding:**
> "The **natural pipeline** is real and principled... **Quality tooling** is excellent... **Dead‑end/OOS** flows and **budget pivots** are modeled and tested."

**BUT:** 5 blocking issues prevent clean builds and tests.

---

## ✅ What the Expert Validated

### Production-Grade Architecture ✅

1. **Natural Pipeline:** Topic classification → hybrid search → rerank → Gemini → JSON segments → Zod validation
2. **Quality Tooling:** Persona linter, 3-4 judges, drift monitor, artifacts
3. **Dead-End Flows:** OOS and budget pivots modeled and tested
4. **Session Management:** DB → in-memory fallback keeps development moving

**Quote:**
> "The **natural pipeline** is real and principled... **Quality tooling** is excellent."

## ❌ 5 Blocking Issues (Must Fix)

### Issue 1: `store_cards` Schema Mismatch 🔥

**Problem:** Three different schemas in three different places

**Migration expects:**
```sql
store_cards(store_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, card JSONB, cached_at, expires_at)
```

**Cache code expects:**
```typescript
{ store_id, card, expires_at }
```

**Seed script writes:**
```sql
INSERT INTO store_cards (shop_id, store_name, shop_domain, brand_voice, policies, ...)
```

**Impact:** Cache reads/writes will 100% fail

**Fix:** Make cache code tolerate BOTH schemas (provided by expert)

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Issue 2: Shop Resolver Queries Wrong Column 🔥

**Problem:** `validateShopExists` queries `domain` but table has `shop_domain`

**Current:**
```typescript
.eq('domain', normalized)
```

**Should Be:**
```typescript
.eq('shop_domain', normalized)
```

**Impact:** "Shop not found" errors even when seeded correctly

**Fix:** One-line change

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### Issue 3: Build/Run Mismatch 🔥

**Problem:** TypeScript compiles to `build/` but npm start looks in `dist/`

**tsconfig.json:**
```json
"outDir": "build"
```

**package.json:**
```json
"start": "node dist/index.js"
```

**Impact:** `npm start` fails after build

**Fix:** Change `dist` to `build` in package.json

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### Issue 4: Missing `@insite/shared-types` Workspace 🔥

**Problem:** Backend imports `@insite/shared-types` but workspace doesn't exist

**Current:**
```typescript
import type { ChatTurn, Segment } from '@insite/shared-types';
```

**Impact:** TypeScript compilation fails

**Fix Options:**
1. Create `shared/` workspace with types (preferred)
2. Replace with local types

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

### Issue 5: Golden Tests Import Non-Existent Symbol 🔥

**Problem:** Tests import `rerank` but module exports `rerankProducts`

**Current:**
```typescript
import { rerank } from '../../src/core/ranking/reranker';
```

**Should Be:**
```typescript
import { rerankProducts as rerank } from '../../src/core/ranking/reranker';
```

**Impact:** Test compilation fails

**Fix:** One-line change in 2 test files

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

## 🎯 3 High-Impact Improvements

### Improvement 1: Add Explicit Off-Topic Pivot Policy

**Current State:** Implicit in prompt  
**Expert Recommendation:** Explicit "Side-Quest & Pivot" section

**Add to `natural-prompt.ts`:**
```markdown
### Side‑quests & pivots (off‑topic handling)
- It's okay to chat briefly (one warm sentence) when the user goes off-topic.
- Then pivot back to the shopping goal in ≤ 1 sentence by tying their topic to the purchase.
- Ask **at most one** clarifier that most reduces uncertainty.
- Avoid robotic disclaimers ("As an AI…") and avoid sounding guarded.
- Keep exclamations tasteful (0–1) and vary openings; use contractions.
```

**Impact:** Consistent off-topic handling, matches test expectations

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

### Improvement 2: Treat `product_info` as Info-Mode

**Current State:** Only `store_info`, `policy_info`, `rapport` trigger info-mode  
**Expert Recommendation:** Include `product_info` for knowledge questions

**Change in `pipeline-natural.ts`:**
```typescript
// Before
const isInfoMode = topic === 'store_info' || topic === 'policy_info' || topic === 'rapport';

// After
const isInfoMode = topic === 'store_info' || topic === 'policy_info' || topic === 'rapport' || topic === 'product_info';
```

**Impact:** Gemini can answer "Are hotter summers worse for shoe durability?" naturally

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### Improvement 3: Align Exclamation Cap

**Current State:** Inconsistent across prompt, linter, docs

- Prompt: "STRICT LIMIT: max 1 exclamation mark"
- Linter default: 1
- Some docs: "2 allowed"

**Expert Recommendation:** Align all three at 1 (or all at 2)

**Impact:** No more false negatives from judge/linter contradictions

**Time:** 10 minutes

---

## 📊 Smaller Correctness Items

### 1. Double Re-Ranking

**Issue:** `runHybridSearch` ranks, then `pipeline-natural` ranks again

**Expert Note:** "This is acceptable (first pass = default weights, second pass = category‑specific), but be intentional: add a code comment explaining why."

**Fix:** Add explanatory comment

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### 2. Unused `resolvedShop` Variable

**Issue:** `chat-natural.ts` calls `resolveShop()` but doesn't use the result

**Expert Note:** "Either use the resolver's return or remove the unused variable."

**Fix:** Use the returned object or remove variable

**Time:** 5 minutes

---

### 3. Missing Migrations

**Issue:** Only `store_cards` migration exists; `shops`, `products`, `brand_profiles`, `conversation_sessions` missing

**Expert Note:** "Add migrations or a single **bootstrap SQL** for local CI."

**Fix:** Create bootstrap SQL or individual migrations

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

### 4. Inconsistent LLM Model Usage

**Issue:** `narrative-generator.ts` uses `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` directly instead of `chatModel` wrapper

**Expert Note:** "Consider using the same `chatModel` wrapper for consistent pricing/telemetry."

**Fix:** Use `chatModel` or add comment explaining variance

**Time:** 10 minutes

---

### 5. Truncated Contraction Regex

**Issue:** Persona linter contraction regex appears truncated (`...an't`)

**Expert Note:** "Make sure the full set is present; otherwise good answers may get false negatives."

**Fix:** Verify and complete regex pattern

**Time:** 5 minutes

---

## 🧪 Test & Monitoring Quick Wins

### 1. Fast Health Check Test

**Recommendation:** Fail suite early if `shops.shop_domain` or `store_cards` missing

**Impact:** Saves minutes of red builds

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

### 2. Add Top-K Product IDs to Artifacts

**Recommendation:** Log product IDs per failing test for relevance debugging

**Impact:** Makes debugging trivial

**Time:** 10 minutes

---

### 3. Pin Judge Model + Temperature

**Recommendation:** Write model version and temperature into `judge-snapshots.json`

**Impact:** Reduces drift noise

**Time:** 10 minutes

---
